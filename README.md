This project contains a template to use when creating a new project. It comes with all the standard files which there is expected to be in an open source project on Github. 

## How to use

1. Clone this project and copy the files into your own project
2. Go through [this checklist](../../issues/1)
3. Start developing!
4. Ensure you are in compliance with Sauce Labs [rules of play](https://opensource.saucelabs.com/docs/releasing/)
5. If in doubt, get in touch with [opensource@saucelabs](mailto:opensource@saucelabs.com)

## Readme template

Below you can find a complete readme template for a project. It is the single most important documentation of your project, so make sure you spend time on giving a great first impression to new users and provide the needed information to interested contributors.

---- 

```
Readme.md template below, when setup is complete, delete all content above this.
```

# _projectname_

_description_

Describe what this project does. Keep this language human and friendly, so avoid internal references, acronyms and if you 
have dependencies, provide a direct link to these.

When describing features of your project, remember to explain why these are a benefit and advantage to the user:

```
This project allows you to scale X (feature) in a fast and predictable way (benefit) - meaning you will use fewer resources and can be confident in your X environment (Advantage).
```

Think about your project as a product, consider who your audience is, and how your decisions affect the number of potential users, below is a handy checklist of things to consider before open sourcing any code. 

- **Avoid internal dependencies** Obviously projects that require Sauce Labs specific infrastructure, configuration or process have very limited use to anyone outside Sauce Labs. 
- **Avoid narrow usecases** Does this solve a Sauce Labs-only problem or does it have broarder application - is there things you could change to make it a more general product
- **Have a Product vision** Do you know where you want to take this product? - then be open about it so future contributors are aware. Being opinionated is great and it helps set expectations and the direction for the project
- **Take ownership** Are you are benevolent dictator or open to anything? - consider how you will interact with future contrbutors who expect you to be an active maintainer
- **Safe defaults** How do people get up and running - are there alot of ceremony involved or can you provide a simple out of the box experience so it is easy for users to evaluate your project

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
If possible, provide a quick exemple of how to get this running with minimal effort, so anyone curious can get up and running as fast as possible 
```

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
